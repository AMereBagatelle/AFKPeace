# AFKPeace

The mod to give you peace of mind while AFK!

To use:
You will need to install Fabric API alongside this.  Just drop it in your mods folder like any other mod.

If you have problems, you can contact me on discord, `AMereBagatelle#6536`.
I usually hang out in the fabric discord, so you can catch me there.

Suggest things that you think might be useful!  Use the github issues tab and add the "enhancement" tag.

### Configuration Documentation
There is only one command, `/afkpeace`.
After this command, you will have a few configuration options, to be used such as:
`/afkpeace reconnectEnabled true`
or you may just enter the name of a configuration value to get its current value.
